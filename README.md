# Multi-Model-Object-detection

## Part 1 - Face Detection and Association based tracking
- Utilize OpenCV's Viola-Jones Haar cascades to detect faces in a video scene, process video frames, and visualize face detections over time, achieving accurate face tracking through IoU-based frame-to-frame association.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of face detection, identify conditions where it succeeds or fails, and enhance visualization with unique track identifiers to demonstrate tracking quality.
- Develop and implement a pipeline for processing video data, handling multiple face detections, and creating unique face tracks, contributing to an improved understanding of object tracking in video streams

## Part 2 - YOLO Object detection
- Create and fine-tune YOLOv8n and YOLOv8m models using the Ultralytics library on a specialized dataset.
- Conduct experiments on how dataset size and data augmentations affect model performance, providing insights into model generalization and robustness in object detection tasks.
- Compare various model configurations by measuring AP50 scores, visualizing detection results, and identifying significant augmentations, contributing to the understanding of model optimization in real-world scenarios.
